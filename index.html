          <p class="brand">
            Web developer who is tenacious about finding solutions to problems. I am a triple threat programmer, educator, and musician who views each of my passions as an opportunity for innovation.  I am a recent graduate of the Web Development Immersive program from General Assembly in Washington DC.  I am looking for work in front-end and full-stack web development.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="brand">
            Some technologies that interest me the most are front-end frameworks like AngularJS and React, web APIs, Websockets, and game development.  When I'm not coding I enjoy playing piano, hiking, and reading.

            <p class="project-description">
              For my first GA project, I chose to create a 'Simon' type of game on a piano keyboard. This game was inspired by an ear training game I would use with my students when I was a music instructor. The students would play back a melody after first hearing me play it. The technologies I used on this project were Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Git for version control.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
              I fell in love with this project and had a blast creating it. After getting the basic functionality of a 'Simon' game working, I was able to introduce a variety of other features, like binding the piano keys to a computer keyboard, turning the key lights on or off, free play mode, and even a few songs.
